# PetNet-50

**PetNet-50** is a web-based image classification demo built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transfer Learning from **ResNet-50**. Upload an image of a cat or dog, and the model will classify it for you!

Built by Marvin Guerrero-Rangel.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to showcase my interest in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, and to make my models accessible through a simple and interactive UI.

## 📸 Features

- Upload a cat or dog image directly from your device
- Real-time classification using a trained ResNet-50 model
- Frontend in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Backend API using **FastAPI**
- Model trained with PyTorch and deployed locally

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Model:** ResNet-50 from torchvision
- **ML Framework:** PyTorch
- **Deployment:**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Upload an image from your device
2. The image is sent to the FastAPI backend
3. The model processes the image and returns a prediction (Cat or Dog)
4. The result is displayed instantly on the page
